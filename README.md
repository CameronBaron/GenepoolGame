# GenepoolGame

At the end of 2015, our group of 6 people (2 programmers, 2 artists, 2 designers) were given 3 months to make a game of our choice.
We decided to make a local multiplayer, twin-stick shooter and I am very impressed with how it turned out.

We had many issues initially with Unity;s input manager and multiple controllers, but soon fixed that with InControl.



This is something I am trying to continue to play with and improve to then be able to add it to my portfolio.
